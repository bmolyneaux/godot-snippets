Here are some particularly useful keyboard shortcuts that I
found.

The default bindings for Previous Script and Contextual Help
didn't work, so I changed mine as indicated below. I think
Previous Script is actually supposed to be Control+Shift+Comma
anyway.

| **General**           |                        |
